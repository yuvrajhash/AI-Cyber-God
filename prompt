This Quantum-AI Cyber God prototype will simulate real-time cyber warfare scenarios in a decentralized way. It will use AI + blockchain to predict cyber threats, test smart contracts, and help Web3 projects defend themselves before hackers attack.

How It Works
1️⃣ Threat Intelligence Collection 

AI scans real-world blockchain vulnerabilities, historical exploits, and hacking trends.

Uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to predict future cyber threats before they happen.

2️⃣ Simulated Cyber Attacks 

AI autonomously launches attack simulations on test environments.

Uses Quantum-Inspired AI models for adaptive cyber warfare strategies.

Smart contracts can be stress-tested for exploits before deployment.

3️⃣ Automated Defense Strategies 

AI suggests real-time security patches for Web3 projects.

Users receive risk scores based on their protocol’s vulnerability.

Nano Contracts trigger automated countermeasures against detected threats.

4️⃣ Decentralized War Games 

Users can submit smart contracts for battle testing.

AI simulates different attack scenarios and ranks projects based on resilience.

A leaderboard of the most secure Web3 apps is created, encouraging innovation.
